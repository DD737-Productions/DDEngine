The (in)official DDEngine!

Almost there!
You just need to set up a few things and you are ready to go!

First, install the G++ compile.
You can find this on the official GNU webpage.

Then, install SDL2 and make sure that g++ knows where it is (you can copy and adjust the make file for the library includes).

The next and last step is optional but recommended:

    Install make.

That's it.

Write your code and use make with the Makefile or just your g++ compiler and enjoy!

(No warranty on anything functioning whatsoever except Ubuntu 22.04 which is mildly tested and was used to create this.)

Happy hacking!
