# DDEngine
A little game engine i wrote which can do something and has no documentation or anything just an empty template.

Want a challenge?
Try understanding that mess of a code!
I literally didn't comment a single line of code.

So have fun being frustrated I guess.
Also: I cannot tell if this will even be working with your setup, because I didn't test it, like, at all.
